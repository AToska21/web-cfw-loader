# web-cfw-loader
Fusee Launcher, in a browser!

# Description
This is a port of [fusee-launcher](https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher) to JavaScript using WebUSB. This appears to work on Linux, Android (unrooted), OSX and ChromeOS. Windows support is still extremely unstable and it seems to only work on sometimes.

# Try it out
Either use a web server to host the files (must be on https, because of the fact that WebUSB is new technology and therefore has a lot of security restrictions) or you can try it [here](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/).
